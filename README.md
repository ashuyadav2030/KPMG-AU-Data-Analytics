# KPMG-AU-Data-Analytics

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes and cycling accessories organization, has partnered with KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team to optimize their marketing strategy and drive business growth. With access to a large dataset comprising customer and transaction data, the client seeks KPMG's expertise in extracting valuable insights to enhance their marketing approach. Recognizing the crucial role of data quality in achieving these objectives, our team is tasked with assessing the data quality of three key datasets: Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, and Transaction data from the past three months.

To address this challenge, our approach encompasses various phases: Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation. In the Data Exploration phase, we will delve into the datasets, understanding data distributions, performing feature engineering, and identifying any potential data quality issues. We will then proceed to the Model Development phase, where we will employ data transformations and modeling techniques to derive meaningful insights from the data. Finally, in the Interpretation phase, we will interpret the results, report our findings, and propose a comprehensive marketing and growth strategy for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.

In addition to the analysis, we will recommend the target customers from the new list of 1000 for maximum value. While the lack of prior transaction history poses a challenge, we firmly believe that by leveraging appropriate analysis methods, we can unlock valuable customer insights and optimize resource allocation for targeted marketing, ultimately leading to improved performance and increased customer value.

To effectively communicate our findings, we will develop an interactive dashboard summarizing the data and analysis results. The dashboard will showcase up to three visually appealing and informative views or tabs, creatively designed to enhance data visualization. Furthermore, we will incorporate the client's logo into the deliverable to ensure branding consistency.

Throughout the project, we will consider the business context of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. We will analyze trends within the data, identify the customer segment with the highest value, propose a tailored marketing and growth strategy, and recommend additional external datasets that can provide deeper insights into customer preferences and purchase behavior. By addressing these key questions, our presentation will not only specify the target customers from the new 1000-customer list but also outline the broader market segment that should be targeted for optimal results.

In summary, our tasks encompass assessing data quality, recommending target customers for maximum value, developing a detailed PowerPoint presentation outlining our analysis approach, and creating an engaging dashboard to summarize the data and analysis results. By considering the business context and leveraging our expertise, we aim to empower Sprocket Central Pty Ltd with actionable insights that will drive their marketing strategy and fuel business growth.
